# counter

A minimal [celld](https://celld.dev) app: a Durable Object counter and an R2
file store. It runs on the remote dev VM's celld, which keeps its state in
minio's `celld` bucket.

Turn celld on with `echo/scripts/remote-dev.sh init` (answer `y` to "Run
celld?"), then `remote-dev.sh up --skip-setup`. Install `celld` itself with
`curl -fsSL https://celld.dev/install.sh | sh`; esbuild comes from
`pnpm install`. Then, with `remote-dev.sh tunnel` open:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run deploy    # not `pnpm deploy`, which is pnpm's own command
```

The node picks the new version up within about five seconds:

```sh
curl localhost:8787/count?name=a          # {"n":0}
curl -X POST localhost:8787/count?name=a  # {"n":1}
curl -X POST localhost:8787/count?name=a  # {"n":2}
curl -X PUT --data hello localhost:8787/files/greeting
curl localhost:8787/files/greeting        # hello
curl localhost:8787/files                 # [{"key":"greeting","size":5}]
curl -X DELETE localhost:8787/files/greeting
```

The objects are visible in the minio console (http://localhost:9001, bucket
`celld`).

`pnpm dev` runs the app locally instead (http://localhost:9876 by default),
with its state in `.celld/dev/` and no VM involved.
